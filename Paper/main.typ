  abstract: [
    The process of scientific writing is often tangled up with the intricacies of
    typesetting, leading to frustration and wasted time for researchers. In this
    paper, we introduce Typst, a new typesetting system designed specifically for
    scientific writing. Typst untangles the typesetting process, allowing
    researchers to compose papers faster. In a series of experiments we demonstrate
    that Typst offers several advantages, including faster document creation,
    simplified syntax, and increased ease-of-use.

= Introduction (in-text citations not added)
In the United States, the debate surrounding gun control has deep historical
roots, going back to the initial draft of the Bill of Rights and the addition of
the Second Amendment. This amendment, which grants private citizens the right to
keep and bear arms, has been debated for centuries, with pro-gun right
enthusiasts arguing that gun control legislation destroys their culture,
tradition, and right to protect themselves, and pro-gun control activists
arguing that statistics show guns are more used for murders than self-defense
(Hogan & Rood, 2015). The urgency of this debate was highlighted in 2021 when
the CDC reported that out of 26,031 murders, 81% involved a firearm (Gramlich,
2023).

In this paper, gun control will refer to any act of regulation towards the
manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms
(Kleck, 1986). This paper aims to understand the rhetorical strategies utilized
in federal gun control cases. Rhetorical strategies refer to the techniques used
in arguments to persuade or influence audiences, often through appeals to
emotion, logic, or credibility.

Several studies have illuminated the broader discourse on gun control. For
instance, a machine learning analysis of Twitter reactions to the Sandy Hook
School shooting in 2012 categorized tweets into pro-gun and anti-gun sentiments,
revealing the public's immediate and sustained emotional responses. Another
study contrasted the polarized rhetoric of Arkansas politicians on Twitter with
the more neutral framing in local newspapers, highlighting the varied platforms
and tones of the debate.

However, this paper does not take a side in the gun control debate. Instead, the
purpose of this paper is to understand the rhetorical strategies employed within
federal gun control cases to influence the judicial opinion. While sentiment
analysis has been applied to various contentious issues, such as abortion laws,
the specific application to federal gun control cases remains largely uncharted.
This research seeks to bridge this gap, offering a fresh perspective on the
linguistic strategies that shape the gun control debate within the legal arena.

The application of sentiment analysis in the legal domain has been explored in
various capacities. For instance, Liu and Chen (2017) proposed a two-phase
sentiment analysis approach tailored for predicting judgments in legal cases.
This approach involves different levels or methods of analysis to enhance the
accuracy of predictions. These methodologies reinforce the potential of
sentiment analysis in the legal sector, not just for judgment prediction but
also for understanding the nuances of legal arguments and the sentiments they
convey.

The gun control debate, while rooted in legal and constitutional arguments, is
also deeply intertwined with societal values, cultural norms, and political
ideologies. For example, different states have shown varied responses to
gun-related incidents, as shown by Twitter reactions to the Sandy Hook shooting.
States with the highest gun ownership didn't necessarily show the strongest
pro-gun sentiments. Instead, states like California, Texas, and New York had the
most pronounced pro-gun feelings. Such findings challenge conventional wisdom
and underscore the complexity of the gun control debate.

Furthermore, traditional and digital media's role in shaping public opinion
cannot be understated. The study on Arkansas politicians' tweets versus local
newspaper coverage revealed stark differences in framing and sentiment. While
politicians employed highly polarized words resonating with their local
constituents' core values, local newspapers presented a more unbiased frame.
Such insights are crucial in understanding the broader ecosystem of the gun
control debate and the myriad factors that influence public sentiment. The legal
landscape of gun control has evolved significantly over the years. From landmark
cases that have set precedents to legislative changes at both federal and state
levels, the trajectory of gun control laws offers a rich tapestry of legal
arguments, societal reactions, and political maneuverings. This research will
delve into specific federal gun control cases, analyzing the language, tone, and
sentiment of court opinions, transcripts, and legal briefs.

Moreover, the implications of this research extend beyond the academic realm. By
understanding the linguistic strategies and sentiments in federal gun control
cases, policymakers can make more informed decisions, legal practitioners can
craft more persuasive arguments, and the general public can engage in more
nuanced discussions on the topic.

In addition, the methodology employed in this research, leveraging advanced
Natural Language Processing techniques, can serve as a blueprint for future
studies in other domains. The potential of sentiment analysis, especially when
combined with other NLP techniques, is vast and can provide invaluable insights
into various topics. In conclusion, this research aims to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the rhetorical strategies in federal gun control
cases. By employing advanced Natural Language Processing techniques and
sentiment analysis algorithms, it seeks to uncover the underlying sentiments,
emotions, and linguistic patterns that have shaped the gun control debate in the
legal arena over the years. The findings from this research will not only
contribute to the academic discourse on gun control but also offer valuable
insights for a broader audience. This endeavor hopes to foster a more informed
and empathetic public discourse on a deeply divisive issue.
