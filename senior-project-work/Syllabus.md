### Course Goals:

Example (based on AP Literature description):
[Project Title] has two main objectives: first, I will gain a thorough introduction to the history of literature written originally in English, and second, I will acquire the skills and practice necessary to succeed on the AP Literature and Composition Exam and in the college classroom. In pursuit of these goals, the orientation of the course is simultaneously historical and literary: I will learn as much about the scope and chronology of philosophical movements that affect the history of literature written in English as I will about the interests and literary techniques of specific authors and works. In addition, a great portion of my energy will be devoted to acquiring and practicing the skills tested on the AP Exam and used on a daily basis in the college classroom.

### Course Texts:

At least 2 full length books and at least three scholarly articles - **no Wikipedia!!**
Use proper bibliographic format.

### Weekly Schedule (12 weeks):

You must have reading assignments and tasks for each week. Be sure to also include the time table for your Project Product in your weekly schedule. You will need to work with both your BASIS advisor and your On-site advisor to complete this. We understand that you may have to revise this as you go.
To be clear, be sure to include both the work you will be performing in your internship and whatever independent research and work you will be performing in any given week.
If you do not know the specific tasks you will be performing from week-to-week during your internship, that's OK for now, but you must talk to your internship advisor as soon as possible and be as detailed as you can be.
