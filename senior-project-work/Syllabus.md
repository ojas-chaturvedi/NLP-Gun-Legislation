### Course Goals:

Example (based on AP Literature description):
[Project Title] has two main objectives: first, I will gain a thorough introduction to the history of literature written originally in English, and second, I will acquire the skills and practice necessary to succeed on the AP Literature and Composition Exam and in the college classroom. In pursuit of these goals, the orientation of the course is simultaneously historical and literary: I will learn as much about the scope and chronology of philosophical movements that affect the history of literature written in English as I will about the interests and literary techniques of specific authors and works. In addition, a great portion of my energy will be devoted to acquiring and practicing the skills tested on the AP Exam and used on a daily basis in the college classroom.
