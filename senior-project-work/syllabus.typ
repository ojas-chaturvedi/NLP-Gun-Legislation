== Course Goals:
This project has two main objectives: This project has two primary objectives:
Firstly, it aims to conduct a comprehensive sentiment analysis of gun control
legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress between the 107th and 118th sessions
(2001-2024). This analysis will involve categorizing bills into pro-gun rights
and pro-gun control stances based on the emotional tones and framing strategies
present in the legislative language. Secondly, it seeks to investigate how
different sides frame the issue of gun control through an in-depth understanding
of the language and tone used in the legislation. This will provide insights
into how lawmakers convey their messages on this contentious issue and how the
public might perceive the bills. Through these objectives, the project aims to
enhance our understanding of the emotional dimensions of gun control legislation
and contribute valuable insights to the field of legislative analysis.

== Project Product Description:

I will produce a 4000-5000 word research paper that conveys the results and
insights derived from my multi-model sentiment analysis of congressional gun
control legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress during the 107th to 117th
sessions (2001-2023). Additionally, I will deliver a 15-20 minute oral
presentation to effectively communicate the key findings and methodology of my
research. Furthermore, I will create an interactive website for users to upload
their own congressional gun legislation and experience the sentiment analysis
process firsthand. In addition, extensive documentation detailing the entire
project will be provided for reference.

== Weekly Schedule:

You must have reading assignments and tasks for each week. Be sure to also
include the time table for your Project Product in your weekly schedule. You
will need to work with both your BASIS advisor and your On-site advisor to
complete this. We understand that you may have to revise this as you go.\ \
To be clear, be sure to include both the work you will be performing in your
internship and whatever independent research and work you will be performing in
any given week.\ \
If you do not know the specific tasks you will be performing from week-to-week
during your internship, that's OK for now, but you must talk to your internship
advisor as soon as possible and be as detailed as you can be.\ \
Note: Internship-specific tasks are not finalized yet. Additionally, more
reading assignments will be added on throughout the process as I find more
research papers relevant to my project.\ \
