= Tips and Guidlines for SRP work

== Research Question Wording

Good research questions have the following features:

- Simple
- Require judgement
- Lead to debate
- Has multiple perspectives
- Manageable scope
- Clear vocabulary
- Researchable
- Allow for middle ground

== Project Description

The project description must not just fit within the word-count guideline (250
words) and template; it must be able to stand alone as a description of your
work.

- *Topic:* The project description should begin by explaining to the reader what
  your project is attempting to answer/address/contribute to. Is there a problem
  that needs to be solved? An overlooked topic that could contribute to an
  existing body of research? A form of art that could contribute to awareness on a
  topic? An investigation of a field or career that contributes to your
  understanding/future plans?
- *Significance:* Write why this project or problem is significant. Even if there
  is no indication on how the project will turn out, or what results may be
  produced, #underline[the reader should understand why it's important].
- *External Experience:* Explain where the project will be conducted (whether in
  person or remotely), and state why this location/company/group is a good place
  to pursue your topic of inquiry.
- *Methods:* What methods and means will be used to address the topic? Summarize
  the approach to the topic, and indicate the reasons for it.
- *Hypothesis/Expectation:* This does not have to be a firm hypothesis but rather
  an expectation of the results. What do you hope to do/discover/find/contribute
  to?

=== Tips

- Keep it in present tense as much as possible (incorporation future tense where
  appropriate for results not known, i.e., "This project addresses X, and will
  evaluate the effectiveness of doing Y in Z conditions"). Even if some of the
  results are already known, keep the tone of the project description more like a
  preview. Readers should not see conclusions in the project description; that is
  what the presentation is for.
- Find other readers who can say whether or not the project description is
  cohesive and clear, and if anything can be cut.
- Keep it concise --- try to complete the project description in fewer than 250
  words, as even a 250 word project description might not fit in the allotted
  space.
- Remember that the project description might need to be revised during time off
  campus, so check for email from the advisor or administration often.
- See the following examples for writing the project description

==== Example 1

FAULTY FORENSIC EVIDENCE AND FALSE CONVICTIONS\
*BASIS Faculty Advisor:* XXXXXXXX\
*External Advisor:* XXXXXXXX\
*Location:* Arizona Innocence Project\ \
*PROJECT DESCRIPTION* \
In criminal law, the standard to convict is beyond reasonable doubt. Due to this
incredibly high standard, expert testimony is key to a jury's verdict, and
forensic evidence is the "proof many juries need to convict beyond a reasonable
doubt. But not all forensic sciences are created equally, and faulty forensic
evidence can have drastic consequences. The Arizona Innocence Project has a
number of cases in which scientifically inaccurate forensic evidence was used to
falsely convict, leaving innocent people in prison for decades. Here, we show
the relationship between faulty science and false conviction. By working with
these cases hands-on in the aftermath of conviction, we can examine how this
evidence directly affects convictions and how the truth about its scientific
invalidity can be hidden from jurors, judges, and defendants. Our justice system
is meant to be based in truth and evidence, and improperly relying on forensic
evidence can not only convict an innocent person, but it can set free a guilty
one.

PERFORMANCE TESTING OF MODEL FOR A ROBOTIC PROSTHESIS\
*BASIS Faculty Advisor:* XXXXXXXX\
*External Advisor:* XXXXXXXX Director, Center for Bioengineering Innovation\
*Location:* Northern Arizona University\ \
*PROJECT DESCRIPTION* \
Have you ever wondered what it takes to power a powered foot-prosthesis? Or
maybe you didn't know it needed power at all. For the past few years, powered
foot-prostheses have become more and more popular in the world of physiology.
How does this tie into the human body? The human ankle acts as a spring by
exerting and releasing energy and force into the foot. The goal of the
prosthesis is to generate the same amount of ankle torque that is given off by a
human ankle during the gait cycle. The gait cycle is the sequence of events that
occur during normal walking. By studying the forces exerted and created in the
gait cycle, the NAU lab team can adjust the forces given off by the motor in the
foot prosthesis to match those of an intact human ankle. My role is to aid the
team in collecting and analyzing the data and applying the newly found
modifications to the device. The long-term goal is to allow people with
lower-limb amputations to walk as comfortably as possible along various terrains
and to make walking with a prosthesis feel as if it were an intact human ankle.
By conducting this sort of research, the field of physiology is advancing the
technology used in foot- prosthesis devices which can further be used to advance
the prosthesis devices of other body parts such as arms and legs.
