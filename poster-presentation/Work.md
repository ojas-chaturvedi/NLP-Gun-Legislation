## Project Title

Shooting Through the Text: Uncovering Sentiments in Congressional Gun Legislation

## Research Question

What insights can a multi-model sentiment analysis reveal about the framing of legislation containing the word 'gun' introduced in the U.S. Congress between the 107th and 118th sessions (2001-2024)?

## Hypothesis

The sentiment analysis of U.S. Congressional bills containing the term 'gun' from the 107 th to 118 th sessions demonstrates a clear trend of increasing polarization in legislative language. This analysis indicates that over time, bills have increasingly adopted more definitive stances, either strongly favoring gun control measures or advocating for gun rights, mirroring the deepening societal and political divide on gun-related issues.

## Background / Context

### Contextualizing the Gun Control Debate

**Historical and Contemporary Landscape**: The gun control debate in the United States has deep historical roots, tracing back to the Second Amendment. This debate has intensified, especially in light of events like the Sandy Hook and Parkland shootings, which have spurred legislative actions at both federal and state levels. Advocates on both sides, pro-gun and pro-control, present starkly contrasting views, reflecting the nation's divided stance.

**Public Opinion and Policy**: Public opinion on gun-related issues, often measured through surveys and reflected in media coverage, has shown significant variation and intensity. This fluctuating public sentiment influences political discourse and shapes legislative priorities, demonstrating a complex interplay between societal attitudes, political ideologies, and policy-making.

**Legislative Responses and Diversity**: In response to these debates, the U.S. Congress has introduced a broad spectrum of bills concerning gun regulation and rights. This legislative diversity is seen in measures ranging from the proposed Assault Weapons Ban to laws expanding concealed carry rights, reflecting the evolving stance on gun-related matters across the nation.

### Rationale for Using Sentiment Analysis

**Advancing Beyond Traditional Analysis**: While traditional legislative analysis focuses on legal and policy aspects of bills, it often overlooks the emotional and psychological dimensions. The integration of sentiment analysis permits a deeper exploration of the emotional tone and rhetorical strategies embedded in legislative language, thus providing a more holistic understanding of these bills.

**Technological Innovations in Analyzing Legislative Text**: The advancements in Natural Language Processing, including tools like text mining and machine learning algorithms, offer innovative methods to dissect the nuances in legislative bills. This approach can unearth underlying sentiments and framing strategies, offering insights into how legislators craft their message on gun-related issues.

**Filling the Research Gap in Legislative Analysis**: Despite its wide application in various fields, sentiment analysis remains relatively unexplored in the realm of gun control legislation. This project seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to shed light on the linguistic patterns and emotional undertones in gun control bills and how these may reflect broader societal and political sentiments. The findings have the potential to inform future legislative drafting and political strategy, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of this pivotal issue.

## Definitions

**Gun Control**: Refers to any regulation related to the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms.

**Second Amendment**: A part of the U.S. Constitution that safeguards the right to keep and bear arms, frequently at the core of the gun control debate.

**Legislative Bill**: A formal proposal for new legislation, presented for consideration and debate within a legislative body.

**Rhetorical Strategies**: Techniques used in arguments to influence audiences, often through appeals to emotion, logic, or credibility.

**Sentiment Analysis**: A computational process that identifies and categorizes opinions in text, aiming to ascertain the writer's attitude towards a specific topic.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: An area of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language, bridging human communication and computer understanding.

## Assumptions

**Consistency in Legislative Language**: The analysis assumes that the language used in legislative bills is consistent and structured enough to allow for accurate sentiment analysis. This includes the assumption that the language is sufficiently clear and unambiguous to be interpreted by sentiment analysis algorithms.

**Reliability and Neutrality of Analysis Tools and Process**: The project assumes the sentiment analysis tools and NLP techniques are both effective in interpreting legislative language nuances and inherently neutral, ensuring an unbiased, accurate capture of emotional tones and rhetorical strategies.

**Interplay of Societal Attitudes and External Events**: This project posits a complex relationship between stable societal attitudes and the influence of external events on legislative language, with sentiment analysis expected to detect these nuanced influences over the analyzed periods.

**Representativeness and Generalizability of Legislative Analysis**: It is assumed that the selected bills for analysis accurately reflect broader legislative trends in gun control from the 107th to 118th Congress sessions, allowing for generalization of the findings to broader federal legislative trends.

## Significance / Importance of Study

### Filling a Crucial Gap in Legislative Analysis

This study holds substantial significance in the field of legislative analysis, particularly concerning gun control. While sentiment analysis has found application in various domains, its utilization in dissecting the emotional and rhetorical aspects of legislative bills, especially in the context of gun control, remains largely unexplored. By pioneering this approach, the study ventures into uncharted territory, offering fresh insights into the nuanced language and sentiments embedded in these critical documents.

### Enhancing Understanding of Legislative Rhetoric

Traditionally, legislative analysis has been confined to legal and policy aspects, often missing the emotional and psychological dimensions that underlie legislative language. By employing sentiment analysis, this study aims to bridge this gap, providing a more holistic understanding of gun control bills. It not only enriches our comprehension of the emotional underpinnings of legislative rhetoric but also contributes to a broader comprehension of how legislators craft their messages on this pivotal issue.

### Informing Policymakers, Legal Practitioners, and the Public

The findings of this research have practical implications. Policymakers can benefit from a deeper understanding of linguistic strategies and emotional undertones within gun control legislation to inform their decisions. Legal practitioners can craft more persuasive arguments by tapping into the insights gained from sentiment analysis. Additionally, the general public can engage in more nuanced discussions about gun control, driven by a deeper comprehension of the linguistic strategies employed by lawmakers.

### Advancing the Application of Sentiment Analysis in Legislation

This study pushes the boundaries of sentiment analysis in the legislative domain. By applying advanced Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze legislative bills, it demonstrates the versatility of sentiment analysis as a powerful tool for uncovering the subtle nuances in legal texts. The methodology employed here can serve as a blueprint for future studies, not only in the realm of gun control but across various legislative topics, opening up new avenues for research.

In conclusion, this study's significance lies in its innovative approach to understanding the intricate language of gun control legislation, filling a critical gap in legislative analysis, and offering practical insights for policymakers, legal practitioners, and the broader public. By forging new paths in sentiment analysis within the legislative context, it contributes to both academic knowledge and real-world decision-making processes.

## Method of Inquiry

I employ a mixed-methods approach through advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The approach will focus on sentiment, content, thematic, frequency, and cluster analysis.

The primary data used for the analysis will come from laws relating to gun control, federal gun control case transcripts, legal briefs, and court opinions from 2000 to 2022. These documents were selected using (need to come up with randomized sampling method), ensuring the dataset is representative and comprehensive of the overall field.

To prepare the data for analysis, the NLP techniques will first utilize an algorithm that conducts text normalization and anonymization, ensuring the removal of any identifiable information in accordance with ethical practices.

For the sentiment analysis, I utilize BERT (even though I finalized the analysis and ensured that it works, I haven’t chosen the model yet, but they are all beneficial) for its accuracy and relevance to legal texts. BERT will assign numerical sentiment scores to the text, ranging from highly negative to highly positive, based on a 10-point scale.

For the content analysis, which will categorize the data based on the outcomes (pro-gun rights or pro-gun control), a systematic examination of case decisions and arguments will be conducted to identify recurring themes and rhetorical strategies. Key themes, rhetorical strategies, and legal reasoning will be identified and coded using a structured coding scheme. This scheme will be developed based on initial readings and refined iteratively as the analysis progresses.

To validate my findings, I will cross-reference results using multiple NLP tools and compare them against a secondary dataset.

However, I acknowledge potential limitations, such as the inherent subjectivity and biases within the NLP tools.\*\*
