## Project Title

Shooting Through the Text: Uncovering Sentiments in Congressional Gun Legislation

## Research Question

What insights can a multi-model sentiment analysis reveal about the framing of legislation containing the word 'gun' introduced in the U.S. Congress between the 107th and 118th sessions (2001-2024)?

## Hypothesis

The sentiment analysis of U.S. Congressional bills containing the term 'gun' from the 107 th to 118 th sessions demonstrates a clear trend of increasing polarization in legislative language. This analysis indicates that over time, bills have increasingly adopted more definitive stances, either strongly favoring gun control measures or advocating for gun rights, mirroring the deepening societal and political divide on gun-related issues.

## Background/Context

### Contextualizing the Gun Control Debate

**Historical and Contemporary Landscape**: The gun control debate in the United States has deep historical roots, tracing back to the Second Amendment. This debate has intensified, especially in light of events like the Sandy Hook and Parkland shootings, which have spurred legislative actions at both federal and state levels. Advocates on both sides, pro-gun and pro-control, present starkly contrasting views, reflecting the nation's divided stance.
**Public Opinion and Policy**: Public opinion on gun-related issues, often measured through surveys and reflected in media coverage, has shown significant variation and intensity. This fluctuating public sentiment influences political discourse and shapes legislative priorities, demonstrating a complex interplay between societal attitudes, political ideologies, and policy-making.
**Legislative Responses and Diversity**: In response to these debates, the U.S. Congress has introduced a broad spectrum of bills concerning gun regulation and rights. This legislative diversity is seen in measures ranging from the proposed Assault Weapons Ban to laws expanding concealed carry rights, reflecting the evolving stance on gun-related matters across the nation.

### Rationale for Using Sentiment Analysis

**Advancing Beyond Traditional Analysis**: While traditional legislative analysis focuses on legal and policy aspects of bills, it often overlooks the emotional and psychological dimensions. The integration of sentiment analysis permits a deeper exploration of the emotional tone and rhetorical strategies embedded in legislative language, thus providing a more holistic understanding of these bills.
**Technological Innovations in Analyzing Legislative Text**: The advancements in Natural Language Processing, including tools like text mining and machine learning algorithms, offer innovative methods to dissect the nuances in legislative bills. This approach can unearth underlying sentiments and framing strategies, offering insights into how legislators craft their message on gun-related issues.
**Filling the Research Gap in Legislative Analysis**: Despite its wide application in various fields, sentiment analysis remains relatively unexplored in the realm of gun control legislation. This project seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to shed light on the linguistic patterns and emotional undertones in gun control bills and how these may reflect broader societal and political sentiments. The findings have the potential to inform future legislative drafting and political strategy, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of this pivotal issue.

## Definitions

**Gun Control**: Refers to any regulation related to the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms.
**Second Amendment**: A part of the U.S. Constitution that safeguards the right to keep and bear arms, frequently at the core of the gun control debate.
**Legislative Bill**: A formal proposal for new legislation, presented for consideration and debate within a legislative body.
**Rhetorical Strategies**: Techniques used in arguments to influence audiences, often through appeals to emotion, logic, or credibility.
**Sentiment Analysis**: A computational process that identifies and categorizes opinions in text, aiming to ascertain the writer's attitude towards a specific topic.
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: An area of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language, bridging human communication and computer understanding.

## Assumptions

**Consistency in Legislative Language**: The analysis assumes that the language used in legislative bills is consistent and structured enough to allow for accurate sentiment analysis. This includes the assumption that the language is sufficiently clear and unambiguous to be interpreted by sentiment analysis algorithms.
**Reliability and Neutrality of Analysis Tools and Process**: The project assumes the sentiment analysis tools and NLP techniques are both effective in interpreting legislative language nuances and inherently neutral, ensuring an unbiased, accurate capture of emotional tones and rhetorical strategies.
**Interplay of Societal Attitudes and External Events**: This project posits a complex relationship between stable societal attitudes and the influence of external events on legislative language, with sentiment analysis expected to detect these nuanced influences over the analyzed periods.
**Representativeness and Generalizability of Legislative Analysis**: It is assumed that the selected bills for analysis accurately reflect broader legislative trends in gun control from the 107 th to 118 th Congress sessions, allowing for generalization of the findings to broader federal legislative trends.
